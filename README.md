# StarCollapseSimulation
Simulating a hypothetical star collapsing with Quantum Computing <br>

# Simulation explained <br>

In this simulation, I modeled the collapse of a star using quantum computing principles. The simulation was performed using a quantum circuit, which is a sequence of quantum gates applied to qubits. In my case, I used a single qubit to represent the state of the star.
The quantum circuit consisted of the following gates:
1. Hadamard gate (H): This gate creates a superposition state, representing the initial state of the star before collapse.
2. Rotation around the X-axis (Rx): This gate simulates the rotation of the star around the X-axis.
3. Rotation around the Y-axis (Ry): This gate simulates the rotation of the star around the Y-axis.
4. Rotation around the Z-axis (Rz): This gate simulates the rotation of the star around the Z-axis.
After applying these gates, I  simulated the circuit using a quantum simulator to obtain the final state vector of the qubit. The state vector contains both real and imaginary components, which I visualized in a 3D plot.
In the plot, the red vector represents the real part of the state vector, while the blue vector represents the imaginary part. These vectors provide a visual representation of the quantum state of the star after the collapse.
Hypothetically, in space, the collapse of a star involves complex physical processes such as gravitational forces, nuclear reactions, and the emission of radiation. As the star collapses, its core contracts and heats up, leading to the formation of a dense object such as a neutron star or a black hole. The outer layers of the star may be expelled into space, creating a supernova explosion.
In my simulation, I abstracted these complex processes into a series of quantum gates to provide a simplified representation of the star collapse. While this simulation does not capture the full complexity of a real star collapse, it offers a glimpse into how quantum computing can be used to model and understand such phenomena.
I also calculated the 2D components of the state vector instead of showing it because it was not possible to visualize this on a 3D model as you could see in the chart:
- Real part: [0.0, 0.9999999]
- Imaginary part: [0.0, 0.0] <br>
These components represent the projection of the state vector onto a 2D plane, providing further insight into the quantum state of the star.
This simulation serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the potential of quantum computing in modeling astrophysical events and exploring the mysteries of the universe. <br>
